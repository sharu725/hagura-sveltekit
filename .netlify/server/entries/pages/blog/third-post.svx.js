Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much, always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.</p>
<p>Atticus said to Jem one day, \u201CI\u2019d rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you\u2019ll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit \u2018em, but remember it\u2019s a sin to kill a mockingbird.\u201D That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. \u201CYour father\u2019s right,\u201D she said. \u201CMockingbirds don\u2019t do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don\u2019t eat up people\u2019s gardens, don\u2019t nest in corn cribs, they don\u2019t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a sin to kill a mockingbird.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am.</p>
<p>We believe that we can change the things around us in accordance with our desires\u2014we believe it because otherwise we can see no favourable outcome. We do not think of the outcome which generally comes to pass and is also favourable: we do not succeed in changing things in accordance with our desires, but gradually our desires change. The situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant to us. We have failed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely determined to do, but life has taken us round it, led us beyond it, and then if we turn round to gaze into the distance of the past, we can barely see it, so imperceptible has it become.</p>
<p>The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.</p>
<p>Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It\u2019s hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It\u2019s round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you\u2019ve got a hundred years here. There\u2019s only one rule that I know of, babies-\u201CGod damn it, you\u2019ve got to be kind.</p>`;
